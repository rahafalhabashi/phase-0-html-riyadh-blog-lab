      <p>Once a mudbrick waystation along desert trading routes. Riyadh is now one of the wealthiest cities in the world. The country's political, financial, and administrative capital is also a city with a fascinating subtext.</p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>Riyadh (Arabic: الرياض, romanized: 'ar-Riyāḍ, lit.: 'The Gardens' [ar.riˈjaːdˤ] Najdi pronunciation: [er.rɪˈjɑːðˤ]) is the capital of Saudi Arabia and the largest city on the Arabian Peninsula. Located in the center of the an-Nafud desert, on the eastern part of the Najd plateau, the city sits at an average of 600 meters (2,000 ft) above sea level,[3] and receives around 5 million tourists each year, making it the forty-ninth most visited city in the world and the 6th in the Middle East.</p>

The current mayor of Riyadh is Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman Al Mogbel, appointed in 2012. Riyadh has the largest all female university in the world, the Princess Nora bint Abdulrahman University.</p>
